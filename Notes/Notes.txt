Everything in Python is an object

Python uses imports
import math

Text * is how many times you want to print.
Example print("Hello World!" * 3)
This will print Hello World! 3 times.

Hash is comment out key

Python Peps is style guides, P8 is usually considered the best


variable[1] prints the char at the index of the string
[-1] prints one from the back of the string
[start_index:end_index], end index is not included but start index is
[0:3] prints 3 characters, 0, 1, 2
Can leave start or end blank and it will be infinite, [:] will print entire string copy

backslash is escape character like most

full = f"{first} {last}"
This is how you do formatted strings
Anything in between curly braces will be an expression and calculated at run times

String Methods
len() for length
upper() to uppercase
lower() to lowercase
title() capitalizes first letter of every word, super cool
strip() removes beginning and and end of string, lstrip and rstrip for just one
find("string") and returns the index
replace("p", "j") replaces all p with just
print("string" in variable) is a boolean for if it is in the string
not in works like in just opposite

Numbers/Math
use // to return integer division
use / for floating point division
round() rounds
abs() absolute value

Type Conversion
input() to get input from the user
Input from user always comes in the form of a string
int() integer
float() floating point
bool() boolean
str() string
ord("letter") will give you the ascii Numbers

Simple logical operators
and is and
or is or
not is not
