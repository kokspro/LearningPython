Everything in Python is an object

Text * is how many times you want to print.
Example print("Hello World!" * 3)
This will print Hello World! 3 times.

Hash is comment out key

Python Peps is style guides, P8 is usually considered the best


variable[1] prints the char at the index of the string
[-1] prints one from the back of the string
[start_index:end_index], end index is not included but start index is
[0:3] prints 3 characters, 0, 1, 2
Can leave start or end blank and it will be infinite, [:] will print entire string copy

backslash is escape character like most

full = f"{first} {last}"
This is how you do formatted strings
Anything in between curly braces will be an expression and calculated at run times

String Methods
len() for length
upper() to uppercase
lower() to lowercase
title() capitalizes first letter of every word, super cool
